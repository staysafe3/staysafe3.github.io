			<h2>Circumventing parental controls</h2>
			<p>This website will help you anonymously use the Internet and evade parental controls or censorship/surveilance of your Internet usage by your employer or school.</p>

			<h2>Runaway safety</h2>
			<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220227172107if_/https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.pdf">This guide</a> is a resource I highly advise you consult. The author of the guide is no longer active, but the linked wayback machine archive should help you.
			<p>Please know that swapping your SIM card or similar is not going to help you. Your phone has an IMEI that stays the same after you swap SIM cards, and pinging cell towers will make it easy to locate you.</p>
			<p>The Internet is actively monitored. Nothing is safe online, there are cameras in public, everyone has your personal information, please lay low.</p>
			<p>I am in Germany, we have better laws here, but most places dont. Please be safe</p>
			<p>Nobody is entirely trustworthy, a lot of people believe that they are actually helping somehow by getting the cops to come find you and drag you back to a horrible household. The friend you had since you're 6 years old isnt to be trusted.</p>
